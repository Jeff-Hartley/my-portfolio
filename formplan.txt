Form Structure Plan

Name 
-> input = text, required 
-> error message if it is left blank

Company 
-> input = text, required 
-> error message if it is left blank

Email 
-> input = email, required 
-> error message if it is left blank or improper regex

Telephone 
-> input = text, required 
-> error message if it is blank or not long enough, set to 7 characters (most are 10 with area code.. take into consideration some areas may not have the same area codes)

Message 
-> input = textarea, required 
-> error message if it is blank or not long enough (20 characters feels like a good length if someone wants to be direct to the point)

Confirm data is true
-> input = radio button, required
-> error message if it is not clicked
