        <p id="aboutP">Hello. My name is Jeff Hartley. I am a 31-year-old Computer Programming student in my first semester at Humber College. 
            I started creating and styling websites when I was very young, using free webhosting sites like Piczo. 
            I really enjoy web development and learning different useful coding techniques in JavaScript. 
            My career goal is to work in Web Development or Software Development. Creating useful websites or apps as a career is why I got into computer programming.
            Outside of that, I really enjoy my family time. My family is my life. I'm an avid sports fan, I've loved the New York Giants in the NFL my whole life. 
            Strategic games are a huge enjoyment of mine. I like board games, video games and escape.</p>
